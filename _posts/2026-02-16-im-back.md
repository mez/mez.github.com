It's been a while. Almost nine years since my last post. Life happened, priorities shifted, and this blog sat quietly collecting dust.

A lot has changed. I have a family now, including a 13-month-old daughter who's been teaching me more about persistence and curiosity than any codebase ever could.

But I've missed having a place to think out loud. So here I am, back at it.

No grand promises, just an intention: write more, share ideas, and see where it goes.

Let's ship.
