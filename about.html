    Hi there! Welcome to my blog. My name is Mez Gebre and I am lucky enough
    to be an entrepreneur and a software builder.
    Occasionally, I do consulting work and enjoy solving challenging business problems.

  <p> My problem solving toolbelt includes:
    <ol>
      <li>Full stack development</li>
      <li>Data Science and Statistical Inference</li>
      <li>Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning to produce models that acts on those inferences.</li>
    </ol>

    If you're in San Francisco, shoot me a message; I'd be happy to grab coffee.
