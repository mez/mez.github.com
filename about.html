  <p>
    Hi there! Welcome to my blog. My name is Mez Gebre and I am lucky enough
    to be an entrepreneur and a software engineer. Since 2016, I've been deep in the autonomous vehicle
    space and have been working on general perception & state estimation/localization for robotics. 
    Occasionally, I do consulting work and enjoy solving challenging business problems. 
  </p>

  <p> My problem solving toolbelt includes:
    <ol>
      <li>MVP to Full Scale deployment know-how (need someone that can deploy your ML model to your edge compute fleet?).</li>
      <li>Data Inspection and analysis (I am suprised how by how much people underestimate this step.).</li>
      <li>Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning to produce models that can perform their tasks according to properly documented ODD.</li>
      <li>ASPICE guided systems/software engineering. </li>
    </ol>


  </p>

    If you're in Palo Alto, shoot me a message; I'd be happy to grab coffee.

  I love to learn. Constantly trying to understand more and also be better understood.
  This blog will be my scratchpad and I'll blog about projects I find interesting.</p>
  <p>Find me on all the social sites and feel free to connect.</p>
